# BlockGame
The game is a very basic sample one player PC puzzle game built on Unity. The player is blue, and its goal is to reach the goal (green), without bumping into the patrolling enemies (red). The game has multiple levels, that need to be crossed successfully so as to reach the next level. This game can be used as a sample to further build complex games on.

## Prerequisites
The game requires Unity 2018.1.8 or higher to work further on. Lower versions may not support some features.

## Running the final game
Version 3 of the game can be found in the Builds folder as a .zip file. It can be run directly as an executable.

## Adding features
To build on to the game, levels, or traps can be added by making new scenes on Unity and adding them to the Levels.
